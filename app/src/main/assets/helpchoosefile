<Choosing a file>
You can choose file when you click "choose file" button.
The file picker opens and you can choose the file to analyze.
This app supports linux ELF file format, windows PE file format internally.
However, you may open the other file formats though you have to enter some meta-data yourself.

<How can I choose files at "/data/data/..." or "/system/...", not in "/storage/emulated/0" or "/sdcard"?>
You can use the root file picker developed by KYHSGeekCode(me) to analyze files that require root permission to access.
(Of course you need to have and grant the root permission to this app)

<Please setup manually?>
This message means that the app failed to recognize the selected file's format, and couldn't extract the required data for analyzing.
In this case, you need to enter the file's meta-data such as:

 - foffs of CS : File offset of Code Section start.
 - foofs of CS end : File offset of Code Section end.
 - RVA of entry point : Relative Virtual address of entry point.
 - VirtualAddress : Virtual Address of code section.
 - Architecture : The target machine of the file.
 
 After setting these data, press "FINISH SETUP" button.
 
 <Overriding autosetup>
 If you think the app is misparsing the file header, you can OVERRIDE the metadata for analyzing.
 After re-entering the metadata, press "FINISH SETUP".
